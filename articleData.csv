In
humanitarian disasters
, women and people who menstruate might not have
the necessary items
to manage their periods safely. It’s hard to plan ahead if you need to leave your home in a hurry. And you might not be able to carry your usual items. Your period can create extra worry during an already traumatic time.
Here’s some helpful advice from Dr. Maria Corniero, an OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist) who works with Médecins Sans Frontières (aka Doctors Without Borders), a humanitarian medical organization that helps people in conflict zones.

DIY menstrual pads: How to make your own pads
If you don’t have pads or
tampons
, it’s actually easier than you might think to make your own reusable pad. “Take advantage of an old clean cotton T-shirt (or any cotton material),” suggests Dr. Corniero. Simply cut out a few strips and layer them in your underwear.
Cotton is the best material for DIY pads because it’s a natural, breathable fabric, she adds.
Synthetic fibers, such as polyester and lace, can irritate the delicate skin around your genitals — and make vaginal infections more likely.
Change your homemade pad every 4 to 8 hours, depending on the amount of bleeding, Dr. Corniero advises. And before reusing, clean it with water (ideally hot water) and soap. The pad might still look stained afterward, but that’s normal. Just be sure to wash the pad until the water runs clear.
Hydrogen peroxide is also an ideal cleaning solution if you have it. Don’t use harsh chemicals such as chlorine bleach or lye (aka caustic soda), she adds.
If you have a sewing kit and an old towel,
check out this template from the nonprofit Action Aid
for more detailed instructions (with easy-to-follow pictures and
a video
) for making a reusable pad.

DIY menstrual pads: Use a menstrual cup
If you don’t want to go down the DIY route, the best alternative for single-use period products is a
menstrual cup
, says Dr. Corniero. “You can clean it easily and use it again and again.”
But she acknowledges that even if you’re a regular menstrual cup user, you might not have one with you at the moment.
A menstrual cup can be worn for up to 12 hours at a time. In comparison,
pads and tampons must be changed several times a day
.
What’s more,
menstrual cups collect three times as much fluid as a tampon
, meaning they’re less likely to leak than other period products.

DIY menstrual pads: DIY period products to avoid
Women and people who menstruate who don’t have period products
sometimes use tissues or paper towels as DIY pads
.
Even in an emergency situation, these replacements are a bad idea — and not just because they’re uncomfortable.
Such methods might put you at a heightened risk of vaginal infections
, such as
bacterial vaginosis
, and vulvar contact dermatitis (aka itching and rashes of the vulva).
Avoid DIY tampons too, says Dr. Corniero. Items that aren’t designed to be safely used in your vagina might increase the risk of infection.

If you are using regular disposable tampons, remember to change them frequently. “In times of crisis, I could imagine that you’d forget about it for days, which can be very dangerous,” says Dr. Corniero.
You should change your tampon every 4 to 8 hours
. Going too long between changing one can increase the risk of vaginal infections. This includes a rare but life-threatening condition called
toxic shock syndrome
where bacteria gets into the body and releases harmful toxins.

DIY menstrual pads: How to manage period pain without medicine
Pads might not be the only thing on your mind when managing your period during turbulent times. What if you experience
painful cramps
?
During a crisis, accessing medicine — even simple painkillers  — can be a challenge.
To handle cramps without medication, “apply heat to the affected area,” says Dr. Corniero. A hot water bottle or heat pad is ideal if you’re able to find one.

Self-massage for cramps
You could also lightly massage your lower abdomen using circular motions. Try the following steps:
Lie on your back.
Rub your hands together to warm them.
Overlap your hands on the lower part of your belly.
Use your palms to massage the entire stomach area in a clockwise direction.
Continue the same movement on the left side of your stomach, in one-inch intervals, moving downward. Do the same on the right side of your belly.
Use your fingers to press your navel firmly.
Circulating outward from your navel, continue in a clockwise, circular motion.
If you have trigger points that need extra attention, go ahead and focus on them.

DIY menstrual pads: Keeping clean on your period
If you’re away from home without access to your usual toiletries, you might also worry about staying clean. How do you keep your genitals hygienic, especially when you’re on your period?
Dr. Corniero assures that all you need is clean water to clean your vulva (the outside of your genitals).
“Use only water for hygiene,” says Dr. Corniero. “It is not necessary to use special soaps.”
Your vagina (the inside part) is self-cleaning
, so you don’t need to include it in your bathing routine.

DIY menstrual pads: Stress and period
Finally, it’s worth knowing that it is not uncommon for
an acutely stressful situation like this to impact your period
. So don’t be alarmed if you notice a change, such as longer or shorter cycles.
“It’s very normal to miss a period in times of stress,” says Dr. Corniero. “This is temporary most of the time, and normal bleeding should resume when you go back to a normal routine.”"
https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/health/period/stress-and-period,Stress and period: How stress may alter your period,21 June 2022,29 June 2022,"This article was created in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine for people living in a crisis zone. Any information given below is done so with these circumstances in mind. If you'd like to read this piece in Ukrainian then you can do so for free in the Flo app.
Most people know that stress can have a powerful impact on their mental health. But did you know it can also have a significant effect on your
physical
health too? Yeah, it really does. And this includes
our menstrual cycles
, too.
You may notice stress changes your period. Maybe it comes early,
doesn’t show up at all
, or your cramps are more painful.
We spoke to OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist)
Dr. Barbara Levy
to learn why and how stress can alter your cycle. She also explains when your cycle might return to normal and how to minimize stress.

Stress and period: How can stress mess with your period?
Here are some of the changes you might notice:
A delayed period
An early period
A missed period
A more painful period
Worse PMS (premenstrual syndrome)

Stress and period: Why does this happen?
These changes could be caused by emotional or physical stress (or both).
It could be because you haven’t slept or eaten enough or because you’re physically exhausted, worried, or overwhelmed.
And it’s these stressors that can affect your brain chemistry.
When you’re stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol. High levels of cortisol make the hypothalamus (the part of your brain that controls your menstrual cycle) stop ovulation in its tracks. As ovulation is key to having a period, this can affect when — and if — your period starts.
We don’t know
why
, but everyone reacts differently to stress. Some people will notice these changes immediately. For others, they may take longer to kick in. And some people might never notice a physical response to stress at all.
And as some people are more sensitive to stress than others, it’s impossible to predict which kinds of stress (short term, long term, mild, moderate, severe) will lead to a change in your cycle. However, we
do
know that people with
anxiety and depression
are more likely to be stressed.

Stress and period: When will your cycle return to normal?
These changes shouldn’t be long term. “Typically, once we stop producing large amounts of the stress hormones, the changes will resolve,” Dr. Levy explains.
She adds that most people’s periods will return to normal within one cycle after the stressors are gone.

Stress and period: What can you do if stress is impacting your cycle?
“My advice is to learn techniques for managing our response to stress, rather than trying to eliminate those things that stress us,” Dr. Levy says. “Some people can’t
escape their stress. We can manage ourselves far better than controlling our environment or other people.”
These techniques can help limit your body’s release of stress hormones:
Breathing exercises
. You can try this simple calming breathing technique that can be done standing, sitting, or lying down. Whichever position you’re in, place your feet hip-width apart. Breathe in gently through your nose, letting your breath flow into your stomach as deep as is comfortable. You may find it helpful to count from one to five as you breathe in. (If you can’t reach five at first, that’s OK!) Breathe out gently and count to five again. Repeat this for three to five minutes.
Mindfulness meditation
. This technique is all about tuning in to — and being aware of — the present moment. And you can practice it anywhere, whether you’re sitting still or on the move. Wherever you are, try being quiet while paying attention to how your body feels as you breathe in and out, the sounds around you, and what you can smell or taste. If your mind wanders or gets lost in thought, gently bring your attention back to the present. It can be helpful to do this exercise at the same time every day.
You could also try:
Stretching
Connecting with others and talking about how you’re feeling
Taking breaks from news stories
Sticking to a sleep schedule, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, as much as possible under the circumstances
Moving more and sitting less, even if you are in a limited area
Avoiding smoking
Limiting how much alcohol you drink
Avoiding using drugs/substances in ways other than prescribed

When and if possible, contact a health care professional if the changes last for more than one cycle.
“You may think stress is causing the change, but other medical conditions should be ruled out,” Dr. Levy says. Besides your periods, long-term stress can lead to other serious health conditions, including high blood pressure, prediabetes, and obesity, if left untreated.
Less frequently, it’s possible to develop a condition called
post-traumatic stress
. This can mimic similar episodes in the future and may require specialized medical assistance.

Stress and period: The takeaway
Remember “stress is a part of being alive, and our bodies are well protected from most of the short-term impacts of stress — including weird periods,” Dr. Levy adds.
“That said, anyone who feels overwhelmed, out of control, or unable to function should seek medical help [when and] if they are able to.”"

If your
period calculator
predicts your next next bleed is just around the corner and you want to be prepped to stave off the usual premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms you experience, tweaking your diet could be one way to tackle it. When the PMS hits, try one of these healthy options to help ease your symptoms:
Salmon
Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, this fish is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which relax the uterus and fight cramps. Consider making a meal of grilled salmon or salmon sushi for a dose of high-quality protein and plenty of B vitamins.
Dark chocolate
You probably don’t need another excuse to eat some chocolate. It’s undoubtedly one of the most popular foods to eat during your period for numerous reasons. Loaded with antioxidants and magnesium, dark chocolate is a great comfort food.
Try to stick to plain dark chocolate as opposed to complex candy full of additives and other ingredients. These will only deliver empty calories with little to no health benefits.
However, it's still important to consume chocolate in moderation since even dark chocolate contains sugar and caffeine.
Oatmeal
Oats are a whole grain rich in calcium and vitamins A and B, and they’re also a great source of iron. One cup contains about 14 of your daily recommended 18 milligrams of iron. One study found that a higher intake of the type of iron found in oatmeal was associated with a lower risk of PMS symptoms. Oatmeal is also a great option if you have an upset stomach.
Watermelons, figs, and plums
The natural sugars found in these foods may satisfy cravings for something sweet. Additionally, these fruits are rich in vitamins that can help with bloating. Watermelon also has a high water content and can help keep your body hydrated, which will reduce swelling and bloating.
Citrus
A smart alternative to sugary treats, oranges, lemons, and limes are packed with fiber and vitamin C and can provide relief from
mood swings
and
bloating
. Meanwhile, their high water content also keeps you hydrated.
Combat
PMS-related nausea
and fatigue with a glass of lemon water or a (lightly sweetened or unsweetened) citrus smoothie. Moderation is key for getting a dose of feel-good energy without irritating your stomach.

Eggs
The iron, fat-soluble nutrients, B vitamins, essential fatty acids, and protein in egg yolks do wonders for PMS. But if you have a sensitive stomach, avoid hard-boiled eggs, which can cause gas, bloating, and heartburn.
Chamomile
Last on the list of foods to eat while on your period: chamomile tea. This soothing beverage can help relax your nerves and your uterus. It reduces the severity of cramps, squashes stress and anxiety, and even promotes better sleep.

Foods to avoid during your period

During menstruation, you’re simultaneously losing blood and undergoing rapid hormonal shifts. Opt for foods with ample nutrients like vitamins, minerals, water, protein, iron, and fiber. At the same time, try your best to avoid the following:
Processed foods
Canned foods, heavily processed meat, and other items made with chemicals and preservatives can make bloating and water retention worse. High levels of sodium are unhealthy at any time of the month, but they do even more damage during your period.
Candy and snacks
Satisfy your sweet tooth by choosing juicy fruit, and try to avoid sweet snacks. They contribute to bloating and gas, while delivering a short-term spike in blood sugar. A brief sugar high inevitably leads to a major crash, leaving you feeling worse than before.
Alcohol
When you’re on your period, reduce or eliminate consumption of alcoholic beverages. Why is this important? The loss of blood at this time lowers your blood pressure, making you more vulnerable to
alcohol’s side effects
. It also aggravates fatigue and boosts menstrual flow.

Spicy foods
Already struggling with tiredness,
intense bleeding
, and cramps? Then eating spicy dishes may add gas and bloating to your list of ailments.
If you can’t bring yourself to give up spicy food, you might be better off opting for healthy options like fresh chilis. Furthermore, some studies suggest that cinnamon, turmeric, and fennel could help battle common PMS symptoms, but more research is required to determine if this is true. These spices and herbs may contain anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-hypertensive properties. Just practice portion control to prevent an upset stomach. Always talk to your health care provider before taking any herbs or supplements for your symptoms.

FAQs: Which foods to eat during your period

Why am I craving chocolate?
Eating chocolate releases endorphins and serotonin, which regulate your mood and balance neuromediators, encouraging relaxation. After getting used to this positive reaction to chocolate, your body starts to crave it. It intensifies during your period because of hormonal shifts and the loss of blood and nutrients.
Consider swapping that chocolate bar with a serving of sliced fruit. If that doesn’t seem realistic, then opt for dark chocolate with less sugar when you really want to indulge.

How does eating citrus affect your period?
As mentioned, water with a twist of lemon increases your vitamin C intake and helps you stay hydrated. Fresh-squeezed juices and blended smoothies are awesome foods to eat on your period as long as you minimize the sugar content. Fruit contains plenty of natural sugars, so there’s no need to add more.
What happens if you eat spicy foods?
Each person is unique, and some claim that spicy foods actually fight period pain. On the other hand, those with a sensitive digestive system report feeling nauseous and bloated after consuming spicy foods. Scientists have yet to confirm or deny either of these claims.

Takeaway
There is an abundance of delicious foods to eat while on your period to get you through the monthly pain and discomfort. To aid digestion and regain what’s being lost during menstruation, avoid sugary, salty, and fatty treats and pick heart-friendly, high-fiber meals with tons of fruits and vegetables instead.
When preparing vegetables, cooking them at a low to medium temperature will preserve as many nutrients as possible. Avoid deep-frying them or using too much butter or oil; instead grill, roast, or steam them to maximize benefits.
Lastly, don’t
skip meals
while on your period as this tends to aggravate nausea and fatigue. Choose natural, unprocessed products when possible, and
drink plenty of water
to stay hydrated and manage your PMS symptoms effectively."
https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/menopause/symptoms/menopause-burning-sensation,Can menopause cause a burning sensation in your body?,16 July 2024,Updated date not found,"Have you noticed an unusual burning sensation lately, but you’re not sure what could be causing it? Perhaps it burns when you pee, or your vagina feels curiously hot all of a sudden. Maybe your mouth is on fire, or your hands and feet feel tingly.
Menopause might be the last thing that springs to mind. But if you’re somewhere between your late
30s and your 50s
and your menstrual cycle has started to change, it could suggest that menopause is on the way. This is especially likely if you’ve noticed other telltale symptoms such as
mood swings
or
brain fog
.
Experiencing any type of burning sensation can be uncomfortable and maybe even a little alarming if you don’t know what’s causing it. But once you figure out the cause, with the right treatment, it can be manageable. If it turns out to be a signal you’re in the lead-up to menopause (known as
perimenopause
), remember that there are lots of treatment options depending on your symptoms, so reach out to your doctor for advice.
Perimenopause aside, a burning feeling under the skin may be
caused by any number of things
, from an insect bite to
shingles
. Feeling
burning in the vulva or vagina
might suggest you’ve got an infection, so the best thing to do in any case is to see your health care provider, who can help you find the cause.
If you are on the journey to menopause, read on as
Dr. Allison K. Rodgers
, reproductive endocrinologist, obstetrician, and gynecologist from Illinois, US, shares everything you need to know. From why a burning sensation can happen at this stage of life to how to deal with it, find out all about one of the lesser-known perimenopause symptoms.

Key takeaways
Some women and people with periods notice burning sensations in their vagina, their mouth, or their skin, hands, or feet around the time of menopause.
Falling
levels of the hormone estrogen
—
which is what happens during the run-up to menopause —
are thought to be the main cause of burning, tingling, and unusual skin sensations, says Dr. Rodgers.
Hormone therapy (HT, previously called
hormone replacement therapy
or HRT) may be offered to help treat the most common menopausal symptoms. While research is limited to say whether HT could ease burning sensations linked to perimenopause or menopause, it may help
some people
.
Can menopause cause a burning sensation in my body?
You’re probably familiar with the term menopause, but the symptoms linked to it can start earlier than you think, during what’s called perimenopause. The terms
perimenopause and menopause
are often used interchangeably, but they’re two separate things.
Perimenopause
is the phase leading up to menopause (the official name for your final period), plus one year after. Perimenopause usually begins somewhere
between your late 30s and 50s
— but most often in your 40s. Then, when you haven’t had a period for 12 months (this happens most commonly
between the ages of 45 and 55
), you’re classed as having gone through menopause. From that point on, you are postmenopausal.

Menopause
is a process that everyone who’s born with a female reproductive system will go through. Perimenopause can often signal the start of new symptoms such as
hot flashes
, sleepless nights, and more. These differ for everyone — some people might not notice many symptoms at all, while others might feel them more intensely.
A burning sensation in one or more areas of your body is a possible sign of perimenopause. “Most symptoms of menopausal-related burning are in the vagina, vulva, and bladder/urethra,” says Dr. Rodgers. But other people “may notice
dryness of their skin
and mouth and [more] rarely will have numbness, tingling, or burning in their hands and feet,” she adds.
Experts aren’t completely sure why some women experience a burning sensation in the run-up to menopause, so more research is needed. But just like other, more widely known perimenopause symptoms such as
brain fog
,
headaches
, and
hot flashes
, it’s believed to be caused by changing hormones.
Estrogen
is a hormone that plays an important role in lots of your body’s functions. To make this happen, you have
estrogen receptors in different parts of the body
. When estrogen levels go up and down during perimenopause before eventually reducing for good, this can affect you in lots of different ways due to all those estrogen receptors. One thing that can happen is that
your vaginal lining
or your skin may become
dehydrated and less elastic
, which can trigger unusual sensations such as a burning feeling in your
vagina
,
mouth
, or your
hands and feet
.
Vaginal burning
You may already be aware of one thing that can happen during perimenopause:
vaginal dryness
. This is a symptom of a medical condition called
vaginal atrophy
— when your vaginal walls start to become thinner and dryer — and it can cause a feeling like burning or itching.
“People can feel a dry, tight, painful burning sensation in their vagina,
caused by the drop in estrogen
,”
explains Dr. Rodgers.
Having less estrogen can also make your
vaginal canal narrower
, which may add to your discomfort. “This is caused by reduced blood flow to the vagina and the loss of vaginal folds,” Dr. Rodgers adds.
Vaginal burning can be uncomfortable and may make your day-to-day and
your sex life difficult
. But your doctor may be able to help, so schedule an appointment with them.
Burning mouth syndrome
If you experience scalding, tingling, or even a bitter and metallic taste on your tongue, you may have
burning mouth syndrome
, which is a lesser-known condition that peaks during perimenopause.
“Dry mouth can be a really irritating perimenopausal symptom,” says Dr. Rodgers. And similar to vaginal burning, the
cause is also likely hormone related
. “Since estrogen also keeps the mucosal membranes [the moist lining] in our mouths healthy, the drop in estrogen during menopause can cause dryness of this as well,” she adds.
If your dry or burning mouth starts happening regularly enough to bother you, make an appointment with your doctor. It may be
triggered by something else
, like acid reflux, an allergy, or certain medicines. But if they find that perimenopause is the cause, and you’ve also got other symptoms (
like hot flashes
), hormone therapy may be suggested. You might find it helps with a burning mouth, but keep in mind that it’s not guaranteed to work in this way, as
one study
points out.
Tingling hands and feet
A perimenopause symptom that’s rarely talked about is tingling in your hands, feet, or elsewhere — also known as
paresthesia
. If you notice an unusual sensation anywhere in your body that feels a bit like pins and needles, or if your arms and legs start tingling or become numb and itchy, there’s a chance perimenopause could be the cause. Of course, it’s still important to get checked by the doctor to rule out any other cause.
One study
suggests that just over 30% of perimenopausal women may notice paresthesia, although more research is needed. “This symptom of [peri]menopause is not well understood,” says Dr. Rodgers.
Just like other common symptoms during the menopause transition, these tingling sensations are thought to
happen because low estrogen levels
“cause changes to the peripheral nerves,” she explains. In some cases, tingling in the hands and feet can
happen as a result of low vitamin B12 levels
. Any type of nerve sensation can be unsettling, but there may be things you can do to ease any discomfort. Your doctor will be able to share some advice that’s relevant to you.

Hot flashes
If you notice a burning sensation that feels like heat creeping through your chest, neck, and face, and you are perimenopausal, then it is most likely a
hot flash
. This common perimenopause symptom affects
more than 80% of women
. And if you get
hot flashes at night
, they’re
called
night sweats.
Also known as “vasomotor symptoms,” hot flashes can be uncomfortable and may keep you up at night. In this case, “temperature regulation can help,” Dr. Rodgers says, so dress in layers that can easily be removed if a hot flash comes on, invest in a fan to help you
keep cool
, and try to limit
alcohol
. If none of this helps, speak to your doctor, as treatment options are available.
Dry or itchy skin
Estrogen
is closely linked to skin hydration, so lower levels of the hormone can cause your skin to become less elastic and dehydrated. This can make you feel dry and sometimes itchy. A drop in estrogen also means less collagen is produced, which can leave the skin feeling less supple. Lower collagen can also sometimes
result in a tingling sensation or the feeling of something crawling
on the skin (known as
formications
), although this is more common in postmenopausal people.
How can I relieve menopause-related burning sensations?
If you’re finding your perimenopause symptoms tricky to handle, chatting with people in a similar situation may make you feel less alone. You can do exactly that in
Flo’s safe community space, Secret Chats
. Download our

to get involved in these conversations, as well as keep a log of your cycles, note your symptoms, and more.
Like any new and persistent symptom, the best thing to do is always get it checked by a doctor so they can try to find the cause. If it turns out to be menopause related, there are a few different treatment options they might suggest, but these can differ depending on what kind of burning sensation you’re experiencing.
You can read on to find out more about the specific treatment options for vaginal burning, burning mouth syndrome, tingling hands and feet, hot flashes, and dry or itchy skin. But one thing that may be suggested for all perimenopausal symptoms is to make some lifestyle changes.
Doing your best to lead a healthy lifestyle is always a good idea around the time of menopause, regardless of your specific symptoms. Your doctor may suggest you
aim to reduce stress, exercise regularly
, and improve your diet if possible.
Foods
that are low in fat and high in fiber, like whole grains and lentils, as well as fruits and leafy green vegetables, are ideal. These contain essential vitamins and minerals and will hopefully help to make you feel good. Dr. Rodgers adds that “cutting out caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis” may also help.
Treatment for vaginal burning
“Using a vaginal lubricant or a vaginal moisturizer can be helpful,” says Dr. Rodgers. Beyond that,
a
treatment that can be offered is
hormone therapy
. HT increases low estrogen levels and “reverses many of the menopausal changes that cause symptoms of vaginal burning,” explains Dr. Rodgers. HT is typically
given by
pills, vaginal rings, inserts, or skin patches
.
There are two other hormonal treatment options that can help tackle vaginal burning. One is vaginal estrogen therapy, which is more localized than HT because it’s only used in the vagina rather than the whole body. This can either be applied as
a cream or inserted as a suppository or a ring inside your vagina
. The other is called
intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone
(more commonly known as DHEA), which works by
making the vaginal wall thicker and more moist
. Both of these changes could help to ease the feeling of burning.
Treatment for burning mouth syndrome
There are
a few things
your health care provider might suggest trying if you’ve got a burning mouth. Certain medications, such as ones to block nerve pain, others used for seizures, or antidepressants, may help. Prescribed mouth rinses may also be an option, and “staying hydrated [and] sucking on ice, mints, or gum can often help this feeling,” says Dr. Rodgers.
If the problem is ongoing, you may want to consider trying something different.
Research
suggests that a type of talking therapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could help those with burning mouth syndrome symptoms, so this could be something to explore.
Hormone therapy is unlikely to be prescribed for burning mouth syndrome alone. But if you have other perimenopause symptoms, your doctor may suggest it, and you may find it helps relieve your burning mouth at the same time
. As
with many things,
there are pros and cons of hormone therapy
. It’s right for some people and less so for others. Chat with your doctor about it, and they can help you decide whether it’s the right option for you.

Treatment for tingling hands or feet
The best thing to do is ask your doctor about how best to tackle your paresthesia. Some people
see an improvement in symptoms with exercise
, so try to make time for some movement if you’re able to. If it’s being caused in part by
low vitamin B12
, speak to your doctor about what they would advise. You could also try upping your levels with
foods that are naturally rich in the vitamin
, such as meat, fish, milk, cheese, and cereals.
While hormone therapy isn’t usually offered for paresthesia, if you have other perimenopause symptoms like hot flashes, your doctor may suggest you try it. There’s a chance that increasing your estrogen levels in this way
may help to reduce tingling sensations
at the same time.
Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be something to explore. Although you might not imagine talk
therapy
could be useful for a physical sensation, it has been
shown to help
some people.
Treatment for hot flashes
While hormone therapy is often the
go-to treatment for certain perimenopause symptoms like hot flashes, it might not be something you can —
or want — to use.
If you’re already using
combined hormonal contraceptive pills
, then your doctor might suggest you
keep taking them
in the early stages of perimenopause. They may help ease hot flashes as well as regulate unpredictable cycles
—
another common symptom of perimenopause. Contraceptive pills work by
steadying your changing hormone levels
, which means they can be helpful during perimenopause.
“There are some nonhormonal options to help with symptoms as well,” says Dr. Rodgers. Some
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
, which are otherwise typically taken to help mood disorders, may be one option. Others include a seizure medication called
gabapentin
, a hay fever medication called
fezolinetant
, and an overactive bladder medication called
oxybutynin
. As with any type of medicine, they may come with side effects, so it’s important to discuss your options with a doctor so you know what to expect.
Treatment for dry or itchy skin
When your estrogen levels drop during perimenopause, it can make you less
thirsty
, meaning you drink less and risk becoming dehydrated
—
which can affect your skin. Further research is needed to understand
the link between hydration and dry skin conditions
, but drinking plenty of water is always a good idea to improve your health. Don’t forget that you can consume more fluids by both eating and drinking. Aim to take in the recommended daily amount — which is about
11.5 cups or 2.7 liters
— even if you don’t feel thirsty. You can also
keep your skin in good health generally during perimenopause
and beyond by eating a balanced diet and avoiding smoking.
For crawling sensations on your skin, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping them, but you might notice that these start to ease if you take treatments (like HT, for example) for other perimenopause symptoms."
https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/menopause/symptoms/perimenopause-periods-closer-together,Why do periods get closer together during perimenopause?,27 August 2019,26 June 2024,"If your menstrual cycle has been more or less running like clockwork every month since your teens, it can be alarming — and also inconvenient — if your periods suddenly get closer together. Aside from the fact your monthly bleed is usually a good indicator that everything is running smoothly inside, nobody wants to have periods
more
often, right?
A cycle that lasts anywhere
between 21 and 35 days
is considered to be a normal length. So if your bleeding pattern does shift occasionally within those limits, it’s usually nothing to worry about. Sometimes you might get two periods in one month, for example, or you might get one a little later than expected. But if you’re anywhere between your late
30s and your 50s
and your
tracking app
shows your periods have been getting closer together lately,
it might be a symptom
of
perimenopause
, signaling the start of your journey toward menopause.
Here,
obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Angela Jones, New Jersey, US
, shares everything you need to know about your periods getting closer together in your 30s, 40s, and 50s. But if you have any questions or concerns about changes to your bleeds, always reach out to your health care provider for advice.

Key takeaways
Up to
a quarter of women have irregular menstrual cycles
. This can mean a number of things, like the time between each period being either shorter or longer than average.
A change in your periods is often one of the first symptoms of
perimenopause
.
Fluctuating hormone levels are the reason why perimenopause can cause unpredictable bleeding patterns, such as your periods getting closer together.
Some birth control pills
can regulate your periods in the early stages of
perimenopause
and may also help to dial down some symptoms you’ve got. Your doctor will be able to help you decide if this could work for you.
Hormone therapy
(or HT, previously known as hormone replacement therapy or HRT) isn’t usually offered for irregular cycles alone, but if you have
other perimenopause symptoms
like hot flashes, then it may help. Again, chat with your doctor to figure out what treatment could be right for you.
Is it normal for periods to be closer together during perimenopause?
While no two people have the exact same symptoms,
irregular periods
can be a sign of
perimenopause
. So yes — it’s pretty common for your periods to get closer together during this time. But that’s not the only way they can change.
“Periods can do any number of things in perimenopause,” says Dr. Jones. “They can get closer together, further apart, can skip months at a time, and can be characterized by
spotting in between
,” she explains. “They can [also] be heavy or light, [and] the blood can be light, dark, or brown in color.” In short, any disruption to your periods during this phase of life could well be due to perimenopause.
You’ve probably heard of the term menopause before,
so what’s perimenopause
? The two are actually separate things.
Perimenopause
is what we call the years leading up to menopause (the name given to your final period). This can begin anywhere
between your late 30s and 50s
but most often happens in your 40s. It can take
between four and eight years
before your periods stop altogether — everyone’s different — but on average, perimenopause lasts
about four years
.
When you haven’t had a period for 12 months, you’re classed as having gone through menopause (this
usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55
). From then on, you are postmenopausal.
You might be more familiar with other
signs of perimenopause
, such as
hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings
. Like these, changes to your cycle during the run-up to menopause can generally be due to your hormone levels changing. “Your periods get closer together or further apart due to the fact that the ovaries are starting to wax and wane in their function,” explains Dr. Jones. This means the amount of hormones being produced by the ovaries also becomes quite unpredictable, which is what messes with your bleeding patterns.
It can be hard to keep track of irregular periods and other symptoms when you’re going through perimenopause, and that’s where a
cycle-tracking app
like Flo can help. In the app, you can log symptoms like brain fog and
vaginal dryness
alongside tracking your periods.
Premium subscribers
even get a cycle report each month to help you understand your body better.
What else causes irregular periods?
Your periods might end up a
little inconsistent
for reasons other than perimenopause, so it’s always worth getting checked out by your health care provider to make sure you know what’s behind it. You may assume you’ve had two periods in one month, for example, but the extra bleeding may instead have been caused by a health issue, including:
Polyps:
Uterine polyps
are small growths found inside your uterus that can cause bleeding. They’re not usually serious, but
your doctor
will always want to confirm the cause of any irregular bleeding, so make sure to book an appointment to get checked out.
Fibroids:
Uterine fibroids
are growths in your uterus that can cause changes to your bleeding patterns. Not all fibroids will require treatment, but your doctor will be able to advise you on the best option for you if you have them.
Infections:
Some
sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
can cause
vaginal bleeding
as a symptom. If you’ve had unprotected sex recently and are worried you may have an STI, go and
get a test
. If it does turn out to be an STI, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about — health care providers will have seen plenty of other cases like yours before.
Endometrial hyperplasia:
Thickening of your
uterine lining
can occur at perimenopause, leading to abnormal periods.
Adenomyosis:
This is a condition where the
lining of the uterus begins growing into its muscular wall
, and it can cause heavy bleeding outside of your regular cycle.
Cancer
:
Some
cancers, such as cervical cancer, have symptoms
that include bleeding between periods or after menopause, but rest assured, this is rare.
Whatever the cause of your irregular bleeding — whether it’s perimenopause, one of the medical conditions listed above, or anything else — your doctor will want to get to the bottom of it. So make sure you book an appointment just to be on the safe side.
What to expect from your period during perimenopause
If your periods become closer together or hard to predict, it can be frustrating. It’s nice to be able to plan around your cycle, after all. There’s no fail-safe way to know how your periods might behave at this time, says Dr. Jones, but
Flo’s
clever technology may be able to help you detect some patterns in your cycle and be better prepared. Plus, it’s worth remembering that perimenopause is an important life stage that all women and people with periods go through, and there are plenty of treatment options available if you’re finding the symptoms tricky to manage.

As you progress through perimenopause, you might experience any number of the following changes to your menstrual cycle:
​​
Heavier periods:
Your flow may become heavier over time, explains Dr. Jones, “The period may be heavier as the uterine lining has had an opportunity to build up over months,” she says. If bleeding is unusually heavy (for example, if you’re
repeatedly soaking through your pad or tampon within an hour
), always be sure to consult your doctor.
Lighter periods:
On the other end of the scale, a lot of women experience reduced blood flow or
spotting
for up to a year before their periods stop completely. “Incomplete shedding of the lining can lead to spotting in between periods or lighter periods,” adds Dr. Jones.
Skipped periods:
Your ovaries may not release
an egg
(ovulate)
every cycle during perimenopause
, leading to a missed period. This is often normal. Keep in mind, though, that you’re still fertile. So, if you’re having unprotected sex and you’ve missed your period, consider taking a pregnancy test.
Longer or shorter periods:
If your period previously lasted for four days, but now it’s two or six days, for example, this is normal. You might even experience a random combination of both shorter and longer cycles and
periods during perimenopause
. Again, it’s all due to the up-and-down hormone levels.
Other symptoms of perimenopause
Everyone’s experience of perimenopause is different. Some people find it
difficult to manage
tricky symptoms, such as heavy or irregular periods, while others don’t.
Symptoms vary, but most people experience at least one of the following at some point during perimenopause:
Irregular or missed periods or periods that are heavier or lighter than usual
Hot flashes
that feel like sudden, uncomfortable
waves of heat
and may come with
heart palpitations and dizziness
Problems falling or staying asleep, often as a result of hot flashes
Vaginal dryness
and discomfort during sex
Reduced sex drive
Brain fog
that might feel like a
lack of focus, poor memory, and difficulty concentrating
Mood swings
, including
low mood
, irritability, tearfulness, and
reduced energy levels
Joint pain
or
stiffness
Remember, there are plenty of treatment options for all sorts of perimenopause symptoms — you can read up on them below. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to start discussing which route is best for you.

How to treat perimenopausal symptoms
If perimenopausal symptoms are causing disruption to your life, don’t assume you just have to put up with them. In fact, there are a number of treatment options available to help you feel like yourself again. Some of the main types of perimenopause treatment include:
Hormone therapy:
Taking the hormone estrogen can be an
effective treatment
for many perimenopause symptoms, including hot flashes,
night sweats
, and
irregular periods
. As with many health treatments,
there are pros and cons of hormone therapy
. Chat with your doctor about it, and they can help you decide whether it’s a good option for you.
Vaginal estrogen:
This is a type of hormone therapy that is
used internally
to help relieve vaginal dryness, some urinary symptoms, and pain with sex.
Antidepressants:
Some medications usually given for mood disorders have also been found to reduce perimenopause symptoms like
hot flashes
and night sweats. This could be an option if you don’t want to take HT or if you’ve been advised that you shouldn’t for medical reasons.
Hormonal contraceptives:
Using the combined
birth control pill for perimenopause
may help to
level out your changing hormone levels
and could reduce symptoms in the early stages of your transition toward menopause.
Vaginal moisturizer:
Just like the skin on your face, if your vagina feels dry, then regularly applying moisturizer can help to keep it supple, providing
relief from vaginal dryness
.
Vaginal lubes:
Some people find sex painful thanks to vaginal dryness and less natural
lubrication
. Applying a pea-sized blob of lube before you get started and during sex can be
a great way to stop the discomfort
.
Lifestyle changes:
For many people, simple
lifestyle changes
can help with perimenopause symptoms. “Leading a healthy lifestyle [can help] across the board,” says Dr. Jones. She recommends doing things like “making healthy dietary choices, staying active, getting enough rest, and having outlets to deal with stress.” Are you unsure which foods to include in your diet? Try “adding more protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and calcium-rich foods,” she says. Limiting your alcohol and caffeine intake can also help, as “both can exacerbate hot flashes and interfere with getting a good night’s rest.”
Strength training:
Now would also be a good time to focus on strength training to
build muscle
, explains Dr. Jones. “Decreasing estrogen levels causes a loss in muscle mass,” she says. “Muscle building will help you positively impact your bones, which are also affected by declining estrogen levels.”
Cognitive behavioral therapy:
This
talk therapy (also known as CBT)
has been
shown to be effective
in mood-related and sleep-related perimenopause symptoms, as well as hot flashes. Chat with your doctor for more advice on whether to explore this option.
Treatment options differ according to the symptoms you’re experiencing and how severe they are, so reach out to your doctor to discuss your options. They will likely ask you questions about your menstrual cycle, including the length and type of bleeding you experience, so having a record of it on
an app like Flo
can be useful.
When to see a doctor
If your periods are becoming inconsistent or different, make an appointment with your doctor. “Any change in your bleeding should prompt a visit to your obstetrician and gynecologist (OB-GYN), as perimenopause isn’t the only thing that can cause irregular bleeding/spotting,” advises Dr. Jones. Especially prioritize being seen by a doctor if you’ve got “bleeding that is interfering with your quality of life, specifically, causing you to miss work, or [stopping] you from doing things you enjoy such as hanging out with friends, exercising, etc.” she adds.
If you experience any of the following accompanying symptoms, your health care provider will definitely want to examine you to rule out other causes:
Heavy periods:
Very heavy periods — which Dr. Jones describes as “bleeding through a pad [or tampon] per hour for more than two hours” — accompanied by
blood clots larger than the size of a bottle cap
should be looked into.
Fatigue:
If you’re struggling with low energy levels, see your doctor: “Bleeding that causes anemia or results in signs such as tiredness or fatigue [may be] concerning,” says Dr. Jones.
Spotting:
Bleeding between periods or after sex isn’t always a cause for concern, but it’s a good idea to get it checked out just in case.
Periods closer together:
While changes to your period are normal, it’s still worth being seen by a doctor if you get
two periods in one month
or any other variations. “Bleeding that lasts longer than seven days or periods less than 21 days apart are all reasons to see your OB-GYN,” says Dr. Jones."
